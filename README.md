# impose-pages-for-bookbinding
Shell script framework to impose a PDF file so that it is ready for binding in a book

The script only takes a single parameter, the input file name.

It is intended as a framework that must be modified for each project, as bookbinding
tasks all vary so much. Make a copy of the file and edit the parameters at the top
as suitable.
